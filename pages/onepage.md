banner2: MyData is a decentralized profile data services marketplace. Contrasting with the invasive surveillance-based databases employed by big tech companies, MyData enables individuals to directly review, control, and monetise the data about them. This decentralized approach removes the target that centralized user data stores present, offloads data control legal responsibilities for organizations, and provides the opportunity for new entrants to innovate.
